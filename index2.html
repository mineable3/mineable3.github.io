                            <p>As the team's driver, and programming and electrical captain I wrote all the code for the robot. The code is publicly available under the team Github account. We won our first ever State title with this robot.</p>

                            <p>Available to view on Github is a neural network built from scratch, without the use of python libraries. While somewhat inefficient, it proved itself capable in a case study of it playing a version of Texas Hold'em against itself.</p>
